          Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
          gas-fired stove. Your luxury campting experience includes electricity
          and a sing with hot and cold running water. Shower and restoroom

        <strong><dt>What should I bring?</dt></strong>
        <dd>
          Most guest pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
          changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
          bring a flashlight and sense of adventure.
